# Crowdfunding_ETL
## Python code observations:
When creating the 'Create the Campaign DataFrame', in the step to "# Drop unwanted columns" from the "campaign_merged_df", the instructions don't ask to include the column "outcome", but the started code does show the column in the data frame.  Hence we included it in the code and results.

## Files included in the project folder:
As requested, the following files have been saved in the Git Hub folder:
- 'ETL_Mini_Project_CZea_JOlaniyan.ipynb':  Shows the solutions to the first 3 sections of the project: Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames, Create the Campaign DataFrame and Create the Contacts DataFrame.
- 'crowdfunding_db_schema.sql': Part of the solution of the last section of the project: 'Create the Crowdfunding Database'.  It is the database schema solution saved as a Postgres file.
- 'Select queries to check tables structure.sql': this is the file to run this request: Verify that each table has the correct data by running a SELECT statement for each.

    - 'QuickDBD code and solution.png'
